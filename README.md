### R code

A script run_analysis.R performs the followings:

	- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
	- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### CodeBook.md
This code book describes the variable names, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the training and test data. 

### tidyData.txt
A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
